Here are some stories in Bible.

One of the most famous stories in the Bible is the story of David and Goliath. It is found in the Old Testament book of 1 Samuel, chapter 17.

David was a young shepherd boy from Bethlehem who was chosen by God to become the next king of Israel. One day, he was sent by his father to bring food to his older brothers who were serving in the army of King Saul. When David arrived, he saw that the Israelite army was facing a giant Philistine warrior named Goliath, who was over nine feet tall and wearing heavy armor.

Goliath challenged the Israelites to send out a champion to fight him in single combat, with the winner deciding the outcome of the battle. The Israelite soldiers were afraid and did not want to fight Goliath. But David, who had faith in God and was filled with courage, volunteered to face the giant.

David refused to wear the armor that King Saul offered him, and instead took only a sling and five smooth stones from a nearby stream. He approached Goliath, who mocked him and cursed him by his gods. But David declared that he came in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, and that He would deliver Goliath into his hand.

David swung his sling and hit Goliath in the forehead with a stone, causing him to fall to the ground. David then took Goliath's own sword and beheaded him, thus defeating the Philistine champion and securing a great victory for Israel.

The story of David and Goliath teaches us the importance of faith, courage, and trusting in God's power to help us overcome even the greatest of obstacles. It also shows us that sometimes the most unexpected person can be the one who accomplishes great things with the help of God's strength.
